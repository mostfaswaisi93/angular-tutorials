        The primary objective of this project is to obtain forecasting model for
        the presidential elections. This is done by collecting data from the
        social media on the opinion of the people on each one of the elected
        candidates using the API of the social media website we are going to use
        (e.g. Twitter), then we are going to use a sentiment analysis (natural
        language processing) tool which uses the machine learning to give score
        to each word in the query received where positive words get a high score
        and negative words get a low score, then it returns a score for the
        whole query which we could use monitor the peoples’ opinion on the
        elected candidates in each state, we will then collect the scores and
        present it on a map using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as graphs
        on each state showing the percentage of positivity of peoples’ opinion
        on each of the elected candidates, The program will then predict the
        candidate that might win by using a summation tool to see which of the
        elected candidates has got the highest score. In brief, this project is
        being developed to predict the scores of the presidential elections
        based on using the natural language processing on the peoples’ blogs on
        social media.

      <h3 #Summary>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        The United States presidential election is among influential factors on
        not only the local market but also the global economy. Researchers must
        pay more attention to political events and how they influence the
        development of competitive local markets alongside their influence on
        the global economy. Given the significance of the US Presidential
        Election and how it is capable of influencing the global economy. So, it
        is not surprising that election forecasting has garnered increasing
        attention. Over the past several election cycles, scholars have churned
        out a dizzying array of models that purport to capture the underlying
        structure of past presidential elections and, on that basis, to predict
        the outcome of the election that lies some months in the future, a bulk
        of scholars and politicians in the US have attempted to predict the
        outcome of the elections to formulate policies based on the obtained
        forecasts.
      </p>
      <h3 #Problem_definition>Problem definition</h3>
      <p>
        Modeling a complex phenomenon such as an election is neither a simple
        nor easy task. In some elections, the mechanism of the election is
        complicated, and in others, the candidates present further complexities
        in modeling the event. However, the US presidential election presents a
        slightly less difficult challenge. The bipartisanship of the political
        system in the United States presents a simple situation in which the
        failure of the incumbent party can be considered as the success of
        another party. Most forecasts have chosen the incumbent votes as the
        dependent variable in their models primarily due to this reason. This
        choice is based on the theory that the US presidential election is a
        referendum on the policies of the incumbent party. This theory states
        that people who are satisfied with the incumbent party are inclined to
        vote for their party’s candidate, and people who are not satisfied are
        enthusiastic to vote for the opposing party’s candidate.
      </p>
      <h3 #Objective>Objective</h3>
      <p>
        The primary objective of this project is to model and forecast the
        United States presidential election via the usage of natural language
        processing (NLP). Political and economic variables are utilized in the
        model, and significant variables are identified through further analysis
        and statistical procedures. The dependent variable is defined as the
        electoral votes of the incumbent party. The incumbent party is
        considered as the dependent variable, because it presents further
        related variables such the incumbent president’s approval rate and gross
        domestic product (GDP). Increasing the accuracy of the obtained
        forecasts is another research objective. Moreover, analytical
        parsimonious models are desired to provide forecasts and different
        utilized learning algorithms are further compared based on some
        specified performance measures. Investigating the impacts of data mining
        techniques in increasing forecasting accuracy is another objective of
        this research.
      </p>
      <h3 #purpose>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this project is to model and forecast the presidential
        elections in a new way via using a natural language processing (NLP)
        sentiment analysis tool on the blogs that people made on social media,
        so we can measure a score of likability and acceptability of each one of
        the elected candidates from the peoples’ opinion. As a user of the
        system, you will be able to search for the score of some of the elected
        candidates in a specific area and display them so you can compare which
        of the elected candidates is more likely to win in that specific are.
        This project was implemented for better user experience. This system is
        very easy to access. Also, for establish real time communication, using
        modern and updated technology. So, user can see the update without
        reload or refresh and can communication with the system. This system
        will compatible with user’s android devices such as mobile or tablets.
        Also, so user can easily access the system anytime anywhere. This system
        is very simple and user friendly so, any user can use this system
        easily.
      </p>
      <h3 #Scope>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        Scope definition is the process of analyzing, prioritizing, agreeing on
        and documenting the scope of the project while managing a consistent
        stream of communication to the stakeholders. While this usually is a
        continuous process throughout a project, a definite foundation on which
        the scope is built on will define the project (product or service)
        outcome. This process draws out the functionality the business is
        looking to get and also identifies any constraints and potential risks
        avoiding surprises at a later time. The process touches all the teams
        and departments that would be involved creating a collaborative and
        transparent environment and reducing friction. We use a domain specific
        approach to define the scope of the project. We have domain expertise in
        several areas of: Identify all the stakeholders who will need to be
        involved in the process <br />
        • Admins of the system <br />
        • Users<br />

        Identify all the platforms which will need to be involved in the process
        The project will be developed on a web-based platform, the application
        will run on Web Application and a GIS web map. This web platform will
        offer all the services for the user to be able to perform all actions
        from web browser using the web application. Deliverables:<br />
        By the end of project below should be delivered:<br />
        • Responsive administration backend. <br />

      <h2 #Literature_Review>Literature Review</h2>
      <p>
        Although forecasting has been used many times in numerous fields, it has
        a brief history in political science. Forecasting political events
        started in the late 1970s when Fair (1978) investigated the effect of
        the economic condition in the election year as well the incumbent
        parties in a forecasting model. Sigelman (1979) examined the relation
        between the results of an election with the previous ones. Lewis-Beck
        and Rice (1982) developed a model using the president’s job approval and
        an economic factor as independent variables. Abramowitz (1988) added a
        time-dependent variable to improve the performance of the forecasting
        model. The dependent variable of the model was the percentage of the
        incumbent party votes, and the independent variables were GDP growth,
        the incumbent president’s job approval rating in June of the election
        year, and the consecutive terms that the incumbent party governs the
        country. He used the ordinary least-squares (OLS) method to estimate the
        parameters of the linear regression model. Later, Abramowitz (2016)
        utilized his model, which is called ‘‘Time for change forecasting
        model’’, to forecast 2016 election. Some years later, Lewis-Beck and
        Rice (1992) reformed their model by adding two new variables: the result
        of the previous congress election and the previous presidential
        election. Holbrook and DeSart (1999) used the percentage of voters and
        the last votes of parties, as variables in their forecasting model. They
        employed the OLS method to estimate the parameters of their regression
        model. Wlezien and Erikson (2004) introduced a model using economic
        indices and the percentage of the incumbent party votes as variables.
        They used the R2 (coefficient of multiple determination) and the
        adjusted R2 to evaluate the accuracy of their forecasting model. Later,
        Erikson and Wlezien (2016) employed their model to forecast 2016
        presidential election by adding the polls to their model. An important
        research on forecasting the United States presidential election was
        conducted by Berg and Rietz (2014). These individuals who were political
        science professors in the University of Iowa proposed a method to
        predict the presidential election which is known as the Iowa prediction
        market. Lewis-Beck and Tien (2014) addressed the issue of forecasting
        from statistical models, and the way they might be improved. They used a
        real-world example on the US presidential elections in their work. They
        provided a summary of various leading US presidential election models
        that use various independent variables such as presidential popularity,
        GNP growth, primary support, house party advantage, peace and
        prosperity, and incumbency. Fair (2011) allocated a chapter of his book
        to predicting the result of the US presidential election. The variables
        in his model were GNP, inflation rate, and the consecutive terms that
        the incumbent party governs the country and the percentage of the
        incumbent party votes. De Neve (2014) used data from the 1920
        presidential election to the 2008 presidential election to forecast the
        result of the US presidential elections. The independent variables in
        his model were personal income growth rate, taxes, GNP, inflation rate,
        and unemployment rate. Interested readers are referred to Lewis-Beck
        (2005) on the principles and the practices of election forecasting.
        Serious efforts have been undertaken to develop election forecasting in
        other countries. Ford et al. (2016) developed a three-stage method to
        forecast parliamentary election results from vote preferences in British
        opinion polls. Rallings et al. (2016) introduced a model using local
        government election results to estimate a national equivalent vote in
        the UK parliamentary election. An important research on forecasting the
        2013 German Bundestag Election was conducted by Munzert (2017). He used
        a time-series method to forecast 2013 German election based on many
        polls and historical election results. Charles and Reid (2016) also used
        election results and macroeconomic variables from 1962 to 2015 to
        develop a time-series model to forecast the 2016 General Election in
        Jamaica

      <p>
        The result of the project is the ability to predict the outcome of the
        US presidential elections by getting each candidate a record number of
        positive posts for each candidate on social media platforms. We used
        Natural Language Processing (NLP) sentiment analysis on the tweets
        created by the people to see the positivity of each candidate in
        peoples’ opinion and predict which candidate might win the elections
        based on the score of positivity.  The user choose for a specific
        candidate.  The program use the tweets to detect the winning
        probability for candidate in any state.  The tweets are then organized
        by each candidate name.  The sentiment analysis algorithm gives a score
        to each candidate based on the positivity of his/her tweets.  The score
        is then displayed on a GIS web-map. In whatever project the end
        objective is to meet project’s overall objectives as defined by the: 
        Scope  Time  Cost  Quality The role of this scenario is to harmonize
        the functions of planning, communicating, monitoring and control the
        project in order to meet the project’s overall objectives. - Skills
        Gained:  Team work  New programming language  How to make
        documentation  How to make diagram  Work under pressure  Time
